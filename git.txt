git clone <link>

git commit -m "message"

git status

git push 

// this is the change i made while learnig git.

git commit -a  -m "you message goes here."	// a means all , so all the changes will be commited.

git log   // lets you see all your previous commits you can use like -3 to see only last 3 commits

git --list // will tell you about user settings

git push origin master // we are pusing the changes to our github and master is the branch we are pushing and origin is needed don't realy 				//know why are we using it

=== to push a folder that is already on your pc to git hub.

git init // is used to initialize a folder to github , like i did to sample_project for cs and ml course i was learnig.

// now we need to use
 git add <file names that i want to push to github>   // and then we will use *** git commit -m "message" /*** to commit the file


// to push we need a repo on github so create a git repo without readme.dm so do that and then use command 

git remote add origin (or you can use any name you want ) <link of the git repo>   // to link your folder to github

then use
 git push origin master  // to push changes
